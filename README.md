# Dell Precision M4700 MacOS

##### Update 11/1/2019  Provided plist is for Opencore now  

Releasing this to help others with Dell Precision M4700s.  
I would recommend reading [this guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) and [this first contact page](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/) before proceeding. While these guides use clover, it still much needed info to begin understanding what's going on in opencore. Go [here for an opencore guide](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/) which explains the settings needed for Ivy Bridge systems

### Warning - The M4700 behaves very differently when using an NVidia card vs an AMD one. This *"Guide"* pertains only to using an AMD card.

## Specs

| CPU |  I7-3740QM  |
|---|---|
| RAM  | 4 x 4GB 1600Mhz DDR3  |
| GPU  | AMD Firepro Mobility M4000  |
| Screen  | 1080p IPS (Connects vs eDP -> 10 bit LVDS)  |
| Wifi  |  Broadcom BCM94352Z  |
| Trackpad  | Alphs Dual Point - V3 Rushmore  |

## Graphics
I was able to get my iGPU enabled , which is normally disabled when an AMD gpu is inserted.
TODO: add steps to enable iGPU

## Kexts
You can get more information about these by clicking on the links, which leads to their respective github repo.

* [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) - Needed for kexts such as AirportBrcmFixup and WhateverGreen to function.  
* [AirportBrcmFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup) - Allows 94352Z to work even though it's not native to MacOS.  
* [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen) - Allows us to put in the iGPU platform id and M4000 framebuffer
* [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) - Emulates the SMC and provides sensor information for Battery and CPU.
  * Includes SMCBatteryManager, SMCProcessor, and SMCSuperIO as well, which I use as well  
* [USBInjectAll](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-USB-Inject-All) - Injects all the USB ports in SSDT-UIAC as macOS does not pick up all the USB Ports by itself.
* [VoodooPS2Controler]() - Fixes PS2 Trackpad and Keyboard (Not linked yet, I compiled my own based off of Dr. Hurtz and Rehabman's repo)
* [BrcmFirmwareRepo/BrcmPatchRAM2 (Acidanthera)](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) - Allows the Bluetooth part of the 94352Z to work with macOS.
* [IntelMausiEthernet](https://github.com/Mieze/IntelMausiEthernet) - Fixes ethernet port.
* [AppleALC]() - Fixes speakers and 3.5mm ports

## Config.plist

### Patches

* _OSI to XOSI - Fakes Windows 8 by redirecting OSI calls to the one in the SSDT_XOSI file. This also includes versions before Windows 8 as the DSDT relies on behavior described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/acpi/winacpi-osi).  
* EHC1 to EH01/EHC2 to EH02 - Expected DSDT name for USBInjectAll
* ECDV to EC - Generated by [this script](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap)
* HPET _CRS to XCRS/IRQ 8 /IRQ 0 Patch - Generated by [this script](https://github.com/corpnewt/FixHPET), used with SSDT-HPET

### Droped Tables

* MCFG - Causes crashes with SSDT-CPUPM

### NVRAM Boot Args

* dart=0 - Disables VT-d for macos
* radpg=15 - WhateverGreen power gating tweaks for Radeon GPUs

### Devices
* Pci(0x2,0x0) - Set connectorless iGPU platform to use for Intel Quicksync.
* Pci(0x1,0x0) - Set dual link for 1080p Display, set 10bit panel, set connectors to connect to internal/external displays. [More Details](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.Radeon.en.md)  
The connectors is actually the Buri connectors from within the AMD 7000 Series kext, with the first connector modified to work with the internal LVDS display.  
* Pci(0x1b,0x0) - Set audio layout for AppleALC.kext to fix interal speakers and ports
* Pci(0x1c,0x7) - Fixes SD Card slot by allowing it to use the apple SD card kext within MacOS.

## SSDTs

* SSDT-CPUPM - Generated by [this script] (https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh). Allows the CPU to turbo and lower it's clock speed.
* SSDT-HPET - Generated by [this script](https://github.com/corpnewt/FixHPET), fixes duplicate IRQs and fixes RTC
* SSDT-PNLF - From WhateverGreen, fixes backlight control
* SSDT-SDMMC - Adds the missing SD card device in the DSDT
* SSDT-UIAC - Generated by [this script](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap). Used in conjunction with USBInjectAll, specifies which ports to be injected. 
* SSDT-XOSI - Fakes Windows 8
